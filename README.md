## Bonjour, I am Alpha ✨
### 📱 I am an Android and Kotlin Multiplatform developer

👨‍💻 Android & Kotlin Multiplatform Developer with 2 years of professional experience and 3 years in Android development. Before becoming a developer, I spent 10 years in hospitality, where I honed my communication skills, making it one of my strong points.

🚀 I’ve contributed to high-profile apps like Dakar 2023, Tour de France, and Total, reaching a large user base, and developed B2B solutions. I’m skilled in building and maintaining apps from scratch and enjoy creating projects for learning, with two apps on the Play Store.
